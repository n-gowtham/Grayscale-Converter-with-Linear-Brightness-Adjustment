# Grayscale-Converter-with-Brightness-Adjustment
- This project is an image processing utility designed to transform standard RGB images into grayscale while providing user-controlled brightness normalization.
- The project also compares between grayscale image v/s grayscale image with adjusted brightness.
- Then, the project saves both the images in the same location as the original image. For example, if the input image was 'Desktop/Images/Sample.png' with brightness factor 1.5, then 2 images will be saved in the name 'Desktop/Images/Sample_Grayscale.png' and 'Desktop/Images/Sample_Grayscale_Brightness_1.5x.png'.

## How to use?
- Download and save the python file to required folder. Note that the python file uses libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, cv2. Make sure these are installed.
- From the command line,
  >> python3 "GrayscaleBrightness.py" "Path/To/Sample/Image/SampleImage.jpg" 1.25
